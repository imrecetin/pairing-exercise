If I had more time, What I would like to do better?

clarifying requirements

* discuss my approach to breaking down requirements into user stories with well-defined acceptance criteria
* actively question assumptions to uncover hidden requirements or potential misunderstandings

production-ready approach

* recognize importance of logging and monitoring for better visibility into system behavior and potential issues
* recognize importance of component stability with health check mechanisms (liveness, readiness probes)
* follow company standards and best practices

unit tests and integration tests

* create a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate individual parties
* add more integration tests to ensure that different parts of the system work seamlessly together
    * such as API level, persistent level
* commit to achieving high code coverage and maintaining a robust testing strategy to get better isolated testing env

domain-driven Design (DDD)

* gain knowledge in practice as I like the domain drive design coding approaches
* use commands, event messages in informed data format and their respective handlers
    * I feel the problem could be definitely solved way better by DDD approach

dockerization

* plan to leverage Spring Boot's profiling capabilities to manage configuration for different environments (development, staging, production)
* maintain environment-specific configurations/enhancements for the flexibility and maintainability of the application

scalability and performance

* design the API for scalability, considering factors like caching, load balancing, and database optimization
* design the API for resilience using the idempotent approach, fail over cases to handle unexpected moments, rate limiter, circuit breaker
* recognize importance of performance testing to identify and address potential bottlenecks

documentation

* bring comprehensive documentation for both the API and the codebase
* maintain clear, standardized and traceable documentation to facilitate impact analysis and change management

feedback loop and iterative improvement

* dedicate to continuous improvement by establishing a feedback loop based on retrospectives, post-implementation reviews, and monitoring data
* open to iterating on the design and implementation based on feedback from users, stakeholders and engineers in the team
